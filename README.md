  > **This is a fork of the original PhyloNetworks.jl package. It is a hacky
  > version that is trying to remove the plotting dependencies Rcall and Gadfly
  > so that I can use the package on a cluster.**

The solution to the install issue was to individually `include()` each of
the local modules and the necessary Julia Packages (`DataFrames` and
`Combinatorics.combinations`). I then made another Julia script in the
`src/` folder called `hack.jl` that has all of the functionality I
want/need. All I'm doing is comparing estimates of quartet concordance
factors, so the only function I really need is `readTree2CF()`. The
`hack.jl` has all of the necessary imports and includes to do this without
actually installing or loading the rest of the PhyloNetworks package.

I've also realized that the `functions.jl` script does not rely on the plotting
functions and can be included to use all the other methods. It appears Issue #16
is also associated with the problems I've been having.

## Overview

PhyloNetworks is a [Julia](http://julialang.org) package with utilities to:
- read / write phylogenetic trees and networks,
  in (extended) Newick format.
  Networks are considered explicit: nodes represent ancestral species.
  They can be rooted or unrooted.
- plot networks (and trees)
- manipulate networks: re-root, prune taxa, remove hybrid edges,
  extract the major tree from a network, extract displayed networks / trees
- compare networks / trees with dissimilarity measures
  (Robinson-Foulds distance on trees)
- summarize samples of bootstrap networks (or trees)
  with edge and node support
- estimate species networks from multilocus data (see below)
- phylogenetic comparative methods for continuous trait evolution
  on species networks / trees

SNaQ implements the statistical inference method in Sol&iacute;s-Lemus and An&eacute;
[(2016)](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005896).
The procedure involves a
numerical optimization of branch lengths and inheritance probabilities
and a heuristic search in the space of phylogenetic
networks.
